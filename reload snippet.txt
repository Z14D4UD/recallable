Project is Recallable (React + Express + MongoDB). Use the folder tree in the Master Context Document as the single source of truth. Entrypoints: client/src/App.js and server/server.js. OpenAI at server/services/openaiService.js; JWT auth with config/passport.js; SRS in server/services/srsService.js. Keep header/nav consistent with /src/styles. When I ask for file edits, return the full file with all unchanged code preserved. Do not move/rename files unless I say so.
